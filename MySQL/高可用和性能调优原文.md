## maraiadb replication  documentation on standard primary and replica replication 标准的主复制和副本复制

The teams master and slave have historicaally been used in replication, but the terms terms primary and replica are now preferred. The old terms are used throughout the documentation, and in mariadb commands. although mariadb 10.5 has begun the process of renameing. The documentation will follow over time .

在过去一直使用 master 和 slave 来形容复制关系，在新的团队文档和命令中已经逐步开始替换为 primary  和 replicat 来描述。 具体内容查看 MDEV-18777 



Replication is a feature allowing the contents of one or more services (called master) to be mirrored on one or more servers(called slaves)

复制是 从一个或多个服务器获取数据源镜像到一个或多个从服务器

You can exert control over which data to replicate, all databaases, one or more databases,or tables within a database can each e selectively replicated.

你可以控制要复制的内容，所有的数据库，单个或多个数据库，或者有选择的复制一个数据表。

The main mechanism used in replication is the binary log. if binary logging is enabled all updates to the database(data manipulation and  data definition) are written into the binary log as binlog events, Slaves read the binary log from each master in order to asess the data or replicate. a relay log is created on the slave serer, using the same formaat as the binary , and this is used to perfrom the replication old relay log file are removed when no longer needed.

复制的主要机制使用了binary log. 如果启动了 binary log 则所有的数据库更新都将写入到binary log 日志。slave serve从每个master serve 读取 binary log。 slave serve会创建 relay log。 relay log 和 binary log使用相同的格式,用于执行复制。relay log释放完成后会被删除


A slave server keeps track of the position in the master's binlog of the last event applied on the slave. This allows the slave to re-connect and resume from where it left off after replication has been temporarily stopped. it also allwo a slave to disconnect be cloned and the have the new slave resume replication  from the same master.

slave 服务器保存最后一次从 master binlog读取事件位置. 这样的机制可以处理重联，暂停的情况恢复。还可以处理拷贝从机重新和主机建立恢复连接的情况。


master and slave do not need to be in constant communication with each other. it's quite possible to take servers offline or disconnect from the network and wwhey they come back, replication will continue where it left off.

master 和 slave并不是一直通讯的 当重连后复制会从断开的地方继续。



Replication uses
replication is used in a number of common scenarios.

复制常见场景

uses include:

Scalability by having one or more slave servers,reads can be spread over multiple serves, reducing the load on the master the most common scenario for high-read,low-write environment is to have one master, where all the writes occur ,replicating to multiple slaves,which handle most of the reads.

可拓展性，通过一个和多个从服务器，读操作可以分布到多个服务器上，减少master负载。常用的场景有 频繁读，少量写的场景中。

Data analysis. analysis data may have too much of an impact on a master server, this can similarly be handled on a sslave server, while the master continues unaffeted by the extra load.

可以在从库上进行数据分析，从而不影响到主库的运行。

数据分布式。

Description 

The change master staterment sets the options that a replica uses to connect to and replicate from a primary.
配置 change master 命令所需的参数和选项

Multi-Source Replication
多源复制
If you are using multi-source replication,then you need to specify a connection name when you execute.
如果使用的多源复制，那么连接时候需要指定连接名。

- setting the default_master_connection system variable prior to executing change master ["设置主源"](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/#default_master_connection)

- setting the connection_name parameter when executing change master

default_master_connection
```
set default_master_connection ="gandalf";
stop slave;
change master to master_password = "new3cret"
start slave;
```

connection_name
```
stop slave 'gandalf';
change master 'gandalf' to master_password='new3cret';
start slave 'gandalf';
```

Options

复制必须使用 TCP/IP 不能使用socket 

CHANGE MASTER TO
   MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',
   MASTER_USER='replication',
   MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',
   MASTER_PORT=3306,
   MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
   MASTER_LOG_POS=4,
   MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;
START SLAVE;



CHANGE MASTER TO 
    MASTER_HOST="127.0.0.1",
    MASTER_PORT=3306,
    MASTER_USER="root",

    MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
    MASTER_LOG_POS=4,
    //了解这个是什么选项
    MASTER_USE_GTID
    //复制延迟设置 默认为 0 无延迟
    MASTER_DELAY = 0
